# Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides strategies and tools for testing the project to ensure reliability, maintainability, and performance. Testing is a critical part of the development process, ensuring that components, workflows, and integrations function as expected.

---

## Types of Testing

### **Unit Testing**
- Focus on testing individual components or functions in isolation.
- Use tools like **Jest** for JavaScript/TypeScript testing.

### **Integration Testing**
- Test how different components and systems interact.
- Ensure YAML frontmatter is parsed correctly and rendered dynamically in Astro and React.

### **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**
- Simulate user interactions to verify the entire system works as intended.
- Use tools like **Cypress** for browser-based testing.

---

## Tools and Frameworks

### **Jest**
- Ideal for unit testing React components and utility functions.
- Example command: `npm run test`.

### **Cypress**
- Used for E2E testing to simulate user workflows.
- Example command: `npx cypress open`.

### **Astro Check**
- Validate Astro-specific configurations and syntax.
- Example command: `npm run astro -- check`.

## Best Practices

1. **Write Tests Early**:
   - Start writing tests alongside development to catch issues early.

2. **Mock External Dependencies**:
   - Use mocks for APIs or external libraries to isolate tests.

3. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Ensure components handle unexpected inputs gracefully.

4. **Automate Testing**:
   - Integrate tests into CI/CD pipelines for consistent validation.

## Example Test Cases

### Unit Test for a React Component
```javascript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import Note from './Note';

test('renders note title and description', () => {
  render(<Note frontmatter={{ title: 'Test Note', description: 'This is a test.' }} />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Test Note')).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getByText('This is a test.')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### E2E Test for Navigation
```javascript
describe('Navigation', () => {
  it('should navigate to the About page', () => {
    cy.visit('/');
    cy.get('a[href="/about"]').click();
    cy.url().should('include', '/about');
    cy.contains('About').should('be.visible');
  });
});
```

## Why This Matters

Testing ensures that the system remains robust and reliable as it evolves. By following this guide, you can maintain high-quality standards and reduce the risk of regressions.
