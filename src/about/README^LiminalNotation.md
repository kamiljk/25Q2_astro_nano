# Liminal Notation System

This guide outlines a two-tiered symbolic notation system for representing liminal dynamics: the shifting, emergent relationships that define thresholds, transitions, and complex systems.

The system is designed for cognitive scalability: **Tier 1** provides intuitive symbols readable by non-experts, while **Tier 2** adds analytical depth for power users and researchers. Symbols are inspired by systems thinking, logic, set theory, and semiotics.

## Tier 1: Simplified (Intuitive)

| Symbol | Meaning                             | Example                    |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| →      | Leads to, causes, influences        | Rain → Plants Grow         |
| `—     | `                                   | Blocks, inhibits, prevents | Rules `— | ` Creativity |
| ↔     | Mutual interaction                  | Bees ↔ Flowers            |
| =      | Equivalence, balance                | Energy In = Energy Out     |
| ↺      | Feedback, repeating cycle           | Hunger ↺ Eating            |
| ⟶      | Changes into, transitions over time | Caterpillar ⟶ Butterfly    |
| ⊂      | Is part of, inside                  | Pages ⊂ Book               |
| ↑      | Emergent property                   | Individuals ↑ Community    |

## Tier 2: Analyst-Level (Extended)

| Symbol | Meaning                    | Example                        |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| ⇒      | Strong/direct causation    | Surveillance ⇒ Self-censorship |
| ↝      | Soft/subtle influence      | Culture ↝ Behavior             |
| ±      | Mixed/dual influence       | Innovation ± Disruption        |
| ¬      | Logical negation           | Policy → ¬Freedom              |
| ⊥      | Orthogonal/no influence    | Ethics ⊥ Profit                |
| ⇄      | Feedback loop (reciprocal) | Capital ⇄ Markets              |
| ⇌      | Dynamic equilibrium        | Supply ⇌ Demand                |
| ≡      | Complete equivalence       | Law ≡ Order                    |
| ≃      | Approximate similarity     | Ideology ≃ Belief system       |
| ⟳      | Reinforcing loop           | Popularity ⟳ Attention         |
| ⟲      | Balancing loop             | Thermostat ⟲ Temperature       |
| Δ      | Change/difference          | Population Δ                   |
| ≺      | Temporal precedence        | Trauma ≺ Memory shift          |
| ∈      | Element of / Membership    | Player ∈ Team                  |
| ⊆      | Subset of                  | Team ⊆ Department              |
| ⊃      | Superset of                | Library ⊃ Books                |
| ∴      | Emergent conclusion        | Interactions ∴ Culture         |
| Σ      | Summation / aggregation    | Agents Σ Behavior              |
| ⇑      | Accelerated emergence      | Connectivity ⇑ Network Effects |

## Design Principles

- **Clarity First**: Simple symbols enable accessibility without dumbing down meaning.
- **Scalability**: Tier 2 extends Tier 1 rather than replacing it.
- **Compatibility**: Where possible, notation reuses logic/math/semiotic standards.
- **Modularity**: Individual relationships are composable into diagrams or tables.

---

## Usage

Use these symbols in:

- Diagrams (SVG/Canvas)
- Markdown/MDX notes
- Frontmatter fields (for relation typing)
- Frontmatter fields (`scale`, `section`, `rel`) for semantic modeling
- Visual analysis tools / dashboards

Symbols can be represented as unicode (e.g. `→`), or exported as visual blocks with tooltips or interactivity.

Tier 0 glyphs (e.g., → ⊕ ∿) are used symbolically in navigation, tags, or visual scaffolding.

This notation is foundational to the liminology framework. For higher-level semantic structures, see the **Spectrum of Agency** and [Liminal Lexicon](../lexicon.mdx) docs.
