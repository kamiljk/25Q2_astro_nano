This document synthesizes the system architecture, design philosophy, and implementation powering this digital garden as an evolving epistemic framework.

## Architecture Overview

**Summary:** Flat-file, scale-aware knowledge engine using Astro, Markdown/MDX, and semantic frontmatter for dynamic rendering and recursive synthesis.

The project functions as an **epistemic engine** where:
- Notes evolve across five semantic scales (`nano` → `mega`)
- Metadata like `confidence` and `relationships` shape content evolution
- Frontmatter drives routing, rendering, filtering, and synthesis
- Content becomes increasingly interconnected as it matures

## Content Scales

**Summary:** Notes evolve across five semantic scales controlling layout, prominence, and connections. Each scale serves a distinct knowledge function.

**Scale Evolution:** nano → micro → meso → macro → mega

| Scale   | Knowledge Function | Examples |
|:--------|:-------------------|:----------|
| `nano`  | Atomic capture | Quotes, lyrics, fragments |
| `micro` | Structured units | Songs, photos, commentary |
| `meso`  | Comparative analysis | Collaborations, patterns |
| `macro` | Thematic exploration | Essays, frameworks |
| `mega`  | Recursive synthesis | Manifestos, models |

**Scale Impact:**
- **Rendering:** Determines layout components and visual prominence
- **Confidence:** Higher scales require higher confidence scores
- **Relationships:** Nano/micro form chains; macro/mega form networks
- **Growth:** Notes evolve upward as connections form

**Scale Transition Guidelines:**
- **nano→micro:** Add structure, context, basic metadata
- **micro→meso:** Connect to 3+ notes, introduce comparison
- **meso→macro:** Develop theoretical framework, abstract patterns
- **macro→mega:** Integrate multiple frameworks, create recursive model

## Section Definitions

**Summary:** Content is organized into four primary sections, each with distinct purpose and relationship patterns.

| Section      | Purpose | Content Types |
|:-------------|:---------|:--------------|
| `library`    | Media analysis | Books, films, music, art |
| `liminology` | Theoretical structures | Models, frameworks, notation |
| `links`      | Connection fragments | Portals, signals, references |
| `about`      | System documentation | Structure, processes, declarations |

## Core Concepts & Epistemic Engine

**Summary:** This section outlines the epistemic framework underpinning the engine. The system evolves notes from `nano` to `mega` scale, where metadata like `confidence` and `relationships` play a critical role in the evolution of knowledge. The epistemic engine integrates these principles to promote synthesis and recursive refinement of content.

## Liminal Notation System

**Summary:** Custom symbolic grammar that models relationships across concepts, systems, and media through a two-tier system of glyphs.

### Tier 1: Core Symbols (7)

| Symbol | Category | Meaning | Example |
|:-------|:---------|:--------|:--------|
| → | Causation | Leads to/causes | Propaganda → Belief |
| ⊂ | Containment | Is part of/within | Meme ⊂ Culture |
| ↔ | Relation | Mutual relationship | Reader ↔ Author |
| ⊕ | Synthesis | Combines to create | Art ⊕ Activism |
| ↺ | Cycle | Feedback/recursive loop | Algorithm ↺ Engagement |
| ⊻ | Opposition | Tension/contradiction | Freedom ⊻ Security |
| ↑ | Emergence | Arises from | Interactions ↑ Meaning |

### Tier 2: Extended Symbols (14)

| Symbol | Base | Meaning | Example |
|:-------|:-----|:--------|:--------|
| **Causation Family** |
| ⇒ | → | Strong causation | Censorship ⇒ Self-regulation |
| ↝ | → | Subtle influence | Design ↝ Behavior |
| ⊘ | → | Prevents/blocks | Privacy ⊘ Surveillance |
| **Containment Family** |
| ∈ | ⊂ | Instance of | Tweet ∈ Social Media |
| ⊃ | ⊂ | Contains | Internet ⊃ Web |
| **Relation Family** |

## Content Lifecycle

**Summary:** Content evolves through writing, revisiting, linking, and reframing across scales. Evolution follows predictable patterns from capture to synthesis.

**Lifecycle Progression:**
1. **Capture:** Quick ideas, quotes, fragments (`nano`)
2. **Structure:** Organize, categorize, contextualize (`micro`)
3. **Connect:** Find similarities, patterns, and relationships (`meso`)
4. **Synthesize:** Create frameworks, theories, models (`macro`)
5. **Integrate:** Build recursive meta-frameworks (`mega`)

**Lifecycle Management:**
- Update gradually through incremental improvements
- Track maturity via `confidence` and `tendDate`
- Generate new notes from synthesis of existing ones

## Folder Structure

**Summary:** Astro-based architecture separates content from presentation through clearly defined responsibility boundaries.

## Data & Component Flow

**Summary:** Content follows a clear pipeline from writing to rendering through schema validation, filtering, and dynamic component selection.

## Content Pipeline

**Summary:** The content pipeline ensures a seamless flow from creation to rendering, maintaining consistency and scalability.

### Pipeline Steps
1. **Write Content:** Create Markdown/MDX files in `/src/content/` with semantic frontmatter to define `metadata` and `relationships`.
2. **Validate Schema:** Use `zod` in `config.ts` to validate `frontmatter` against predefined schemas, ensuring data integrity.
3. **Query Content:** Retrieve specific subsets of content using `getCollection('bits', filterFn)` with custom filter functions.
4. **Render Content:** Leverage `layouts` and `components` to dynamically render content based on `scale`, `section`, and `type`.
5. **Connect Notes:** Establish relationships between notes using the `relationships` field in `frontmatter` or in-body glyphs.

## Dynamic Content & API Integration

**Summary:** System intelligently integrates external data without compromising epistemic integrity through a content augmentation model.

**Integration Principles:**
- Static core with dynamic extensions
- Hybrid rendering via Astro islands
- Progressive enhancement for accessibility
- Fallbacks for offline/API failure

**API Integration Strategy:**
1. Create knowledge boundary file in `src/content/bits/`
2. Set up API connector in `src/utils/api/`
3. Build augmentation component in `src/components/`
4. Configure server-side caching for performance

## Integration & Accessibility Guidelines

**Summary:** Dynamic content is augmented with external data without compromising accessibility. The system employs progressive enhancement, semantic structure preservation, and fallback content to ensure that dynamic components remain accessible even when APIs fail or JavaScript is disabled.

## Human-System Symbiosis

**Summary:** The system depends on human cognition and curation, providing structural augmentation to human thinking processes.

**Human-System Interaction:**
- Humans capture fragments based on intuition and interest
- System provides structure through frontmatter and relationships
