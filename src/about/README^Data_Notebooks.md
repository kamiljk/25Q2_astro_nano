# Data Notebooks README

## Overview

This document outlines the purpose, structure, and best practices for managing **Data Notebooks** within the digital garden. Data Notebooks are structured `.md` files that capture micro-to-macro scale data for insight extraction, particularly useful for media breakdowns, content taxonomies, and liminal analysis.

---

## Purpose

Data Notebooks bridge raw data and interpretive scaffolding. They can power visualization, media tracking, comparative analysis, and liminal role-mapping.

## Popular Notebook Types

Here are some specific types of **Data Notebooks** and their use cases:

- **[Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Notebooks](https://pandas.pydata.org/)**: Ideal for inspecting datasets, identifying patterns, and summarizing key statistics. Commonly used in Python with libraries like [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).
- **[Machine Learning Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)**: Document the process of building, training, and evaluating machine learning models. Often created using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) with frameworks like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/).
- **[Visualization Notebooks](https://plotly.com/)**: Focus on creating charts, graphs, and dashboards using tools like [Plotly](https://plotly.com/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), or [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to communicate insights effectively.
- **[Data Cleaning Notebooks](https://www.r-project.org/)**: Capture preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, normalizing formats, or removing duplicates. Typically leverage [Python](https://www.python.org/) or [R](https://www.r-project.org/) for data wrangling.
- **[Simulation Notebooks](https://numpy.org/)**: Used for modeling scenarios and analyzing outcomes in fields like finance, physics, or engineering. Often employ libraries like [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) or [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) for computations.
- **[Statistical Analysis Notebooks](https://www.statsmodels.org/)**: Perform hypothesis testing, regression analysis, or other statistical methods using tools like [R](https://www.r-project.org/) or Python’s [Statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/).
- **[Time Series Analysis Notebooks](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/)**: Analyze temporal data trends and patterns using libraries like [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) or ARIMA models.

Each notebook type combines code, data, and narrative text to create a cohesive and interactive document for analysis and communication.

## Use Cases in the Garden

- Track archetypes, tropes, or narrative beats across media (`scale: micro`)
- Compare genre traits, aesthetics, or liminal motifs (`scale: meso`)
- Build reference tables for symbolic elements, historical motifs, or memetic loops
- Feed structured data into visualization components or cross-linked graphs

## Structure

### Example Frontmatter

```yaml
title: "Example Data Notebook"
description: "A notebook for tracking and analyzing example data."
pubDate: 2025-03-01
tags:
  - "data"
  - "notebook"
  - "example"
fields:
  - name: "Field 1"
    type: "string"
  - name: "Field 2"
    type: "number"
  - name: "Field 3"
    type: "date"
data:
  - field1: "Example 1"
    field2: 42
    field3: "2025-03-01"
  - field1: "Example 2"
    field2: 84
    field3: "2025-03-02"
```

### Key Sections

1. **Metadata**: YAML frontmatter defines the notebook's purpose, structure, and tags.
2. **Data Fields**: Specify the schema for the dataset, including field names and types.
3. **Data Entries**: Store structured data entries in a tabular format.

---

## Best Practices

### Data Organization

- Use clear and consistent field names.
- Group related data entries into logical categories.
- Use the `scale`, `type`, and `section` frontmatter fields to define context.
- Prefer long-form records over deep nesting—favor flat, readable structures.

### Analysis & Visualization

- Leverage tools like Obsidian’s Dataview for querying and visualizing data.
- Use Astro or React components to render dynamic charts or tables.

### Portability

- Ensure notebooks are self-contained and exportable.
- Avoid tool-specific dependencies in the data structure.

---

## Why This Matters

Data Notebooks transform raw data into actionable insights. By following this structure, you can create notebooks that are:

- **Easy to query**
- **Simple to interpret**
- **Ready for export**
