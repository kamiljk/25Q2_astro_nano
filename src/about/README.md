This project is a dynamic digital garden built around liminology and recursive learning. Each `.md` file is a living node — self-contained, richly structured, and connected through semantic fields.

We organize content by:

- **Section**: What type of content it is (e.g., `library`, `liminology`, `links`)
- **Scale**: Its scope or level of abstraction (e.g., `nano`, `meso`, `mega`)
- **Tags**: Thematic or typological filters

These replace folder-driven organization with a flat, schema-first approach.
