## ü™Ñ Modular Entry Templates

Each work experience lives in its own `.md` file in this directory, following the format below:

```yaml
---
name: "YYYYMM_company_role"
title: "Job Title"
company: "Company Name"
location: "City, State or Remote"
start: "YYYY-MM"
end: "YYYY-MM" or "present"
duration: "e.g., 2y7m"
role_type: "full-time / part-time / freelance / contract / learning"
category: "e.g., technical_support, media_buying"
tags: ["skill", "tool", "theme"]
scale: "micro / meso / macro"
maturity: "captured / curated / created / archived"
status: "active / inactive"
---
```

The content below the frontmatter should summarize the role: key responsibilities, accomplishments, and style aligned with your digital garden tone.

You can generate new files using this structure and slot them into the timeline and rendering system automatically.

This directory contains modular work history entries used to build individual cards on the site.

## üìÅ File Naming Convention

Each file follows the pattern:

```
{YYYYMM}_{company}_{role}.md
```

- `YYYYMM`: Start date (zero-padded)
- `company`: lowercase kebab-case
- `role`: lowercase snake_case, concise title
