# Integration README

## Overview

This document is about how the system connects with tools like Obsidian, Astro, and React. The goal is to make sure your notes are usable across platforms, whether you’re querying metadata, rendering content, or exporting files.

## Key Integrations

- **Obsidian:**
  - Use the Dataview plugin to query YAML metadata. It’s great for visualizing relationships and finding specific notes.
  - Export Markdown files for backup or further processing.

- **Astro:**
  - Astro processes Markdown files and exposes YAML frontmatter as JavaScript objects. This makes it easy to render content dynamically.

- **React:**
  - React components use Gray Matter to parse YAML frontmatter. Metadata becomes props, driving dynamic UI elements.

- **Other Tools:**
  - The system is designed to be portable. Scripts or third-party tools can process the Markdown files without breaking the structure.

## Why This Matters

Integration isn’t just about compatibility—it’s about freedom. By sticking to standardized YAML frontmatter, your notes remain flexible and future-proof.
