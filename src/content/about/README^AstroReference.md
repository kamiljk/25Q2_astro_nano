### Project Structure

Inside your Astro project, you’ll see the following folders and files:

```plaintext
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

- **`src/pages/`**: Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files here. Each file is exposed as a route based on its name.
- **`src/components/`**: A suggested location for Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.
- **`public/`**: Place static assets like images here.
