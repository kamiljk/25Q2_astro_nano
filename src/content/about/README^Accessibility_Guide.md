# Accessibility Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines best practices for ensuring the project is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Accessibility is a core principle of modern web development, ensuring inclusivity and compliance with standards like WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).

## Key Principles

1. **Perceivable**:
   - Ensure all content is visible and understandable.
   - Provide text alternatives for non-text content (e.g., images, videos).

2. **Operable**:
   - Make all functionality accessible via keyboard navigation.
   - Avoid time-based interactions that may hinder usability.

3. **Understandable**:
   - Use clear and simple language.
   - Ensure consistent navigation and predictable behavior.

4. **Robust**:
   - Ensure compatibility with assistive technologies like screen readers.

## Best Practices

### **Semantic HTML**

- Use semantic elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, etc.) to structure content meaningfully.
- Example:

  ```html
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome to the Digital Garden</h1>
  </header>
  ```

### **ARIA Roles**

- Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles to enhance accessibility.
- Example:

  ```html
  <button aria-label="Submit Form">Submit</button>
  ```

### **Keyboard Navigation**

- Ensure all interactive elements are focusable and operable via keyboard.
- Example:

  ```html
  <a href="/about" tabindex="0">About</a>
  ```

### **Color Contrast**

- Maintain sufficient contrast between text and background colors.
- Use tools like [Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to validate.

### **Alt Text for Images**

- Provide descriptive `alt` attributes for all images.
- Example:

  ```html
  <img src="example.jpg" alt="A scenic view of mountains at sunset">
  ```

## Testing Accessibility

### Tools

- **Lighthouse**: Built into Chrome DevTools for auditing accessibility.
- **axe**: A browser extension for automated accessibility testing.
- **Screen Readers**: Test with tools like NVDA (Windows) or VoiceOver (Mac).

### Example Lighthouse Audit

Run the following command to generate an accessibility report:

```sh
npx lighthouse https://example.com --view
```

## Why This Matters

Accessibility ensures that the project is inclusive and usable by everyone, regardless of ability. By following these guidelines, you can create a system that is both user-friendly and compliant with accessibility standards.
