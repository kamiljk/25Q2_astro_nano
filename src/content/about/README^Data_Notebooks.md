# Data Notebooks README

## Overview

This document outlines the purpose, structure, and best practices for managing **Data Notebooks** within the digital garden. Data Notebooks are specialized Markdown files designed to capture, analyze, and visualize structured data. They integrate seamlessly with YAML frontmatter and tools like Obsidian, Astro, and React.

---

## Purpose

Data Notebooks serve as a bridge between raw data and meaningful insights. They are designed to:

- **Organize Data**: Use YAML frontmatter to structure datasets.
- **Enable Analysis**: Integrate with tools like Dataview for querying and visualization.
- **Promote Reusability**: Ensure data is portable and adaptable across platforms.

## Popular Notebook Types

## Popular Notebook Types

Here are some specific types of **Data Notebooks** and their use cases:

- **[Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Notebooks](https://pandas.pydata.org/)**: Ideal for inspecting datasets, identifying patterns, and summarizing key statistics. Commonly used in Python with libraries like [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).
- **[Machine Learning Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)**: Document the process of building, training, and evaluating machine learning models. Often created using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) with frameworks like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/).
- **[Visualization Notebooks](https://plotly.com/)**: Focus on creating charts, graphs, and dashboards using tools like [Plotly](https://plotly.com/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), or [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to communicate insights effectively.
- **[Data Cleaning Notebooks](https://www.r-project.org/)**: Capture preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, normalizing formats, or removing duplicates. Typically leverage [Python](https://www.python.org/) or [R](https://www.r-project.org/) for data wrangling.
- **[Simulation Notebooks](https://numpy.org/)**: Used for modeling scenarios and analyzing outcomes in fields like finance, physics, or engineering. Often employ libraries like [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) or [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) for computations.
- **[Statistical Analysis Notebooks](https://www.statsmodels.org/)**: Perform hypothesis testing, regression analysis, or other statistical methods using tools like [R](https://www.r-project.org/) or Python’s [Statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/).
- **[Time Series Analysis Notebooks](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/)**: Analyze temporal data trends and patterns using libraries like [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) or ARIMA models.

Each notebook type combines code, data, and narrative text to create a cohesive and interactive document for analysis and communication.

## Structure

### Example Frontmatter

```yaml
title: "Example Data Notebook"
description: "A notebook for tracking and analyzing example data."
pubDate: 2025-03-01
tags:
  - "data"
  - "notebook"
  - "example"
fields:
  - name: "Field 1"
    type: "string"
  - name: "Field 2"
    type: "number"
  - name: "Field 3"
    type: "date"
data:
  - field1: "Example 1"
    field2: 42
    field3: "2025-03-01"
  - field1: "Example 2"
    field2: 84
    field3: "2025-03-02"
```

### Key Sections

1. **Metadata**: YAML frontmatter defines the notebook's purpose, structure, and tags.
2. **Data Fields**: Specify the schema for the dataset, including field names and types.
3. **Data Entries**: Store structured data entries in a tabular format.

---

## Best Practices

### Data Organization

- Use clear and consistent field names.
- Group related data entries into logical categories.

### Analysis & Visualization

- Leverage tools like Obsidian’s Dataview for querying and visualizing data.
- Use Astro or React components to render dynamic charts or tables.

### Portability

- Ensure notebooks are self-contained and exportable.
- Avoid tool-specific dependencies in the data structure.

---

## Why This Matters

Data Notebooks transform raw data into actionable insights. By following this structure, you can create notebooks that are:

- **Easy to query**
- **Simple to interpret**
- **Ready for export**
