# Digital Gardens & Liminology Framework

This project is our dynamic and evolving digital garden, where each note is an
interconnected, living artifact. It reflects how we think about knowledge—
fluid, adaptable, and always in progress.

- **Fluidity & Interconnectivity**: Notes are self-contained `.md` files that
  are interconnected for seamless navigation.
- **Portability**: We designed documents for seamless processing, extraction,
  and repurposing.
- **Iterative Growth**: Embrace the iterative nature of knowledge—update,
  refine, and re-export ideas as they develop.

The documentation is divided into eight specialized sections, each reflecting
a key aspect of how we built and use this system:

1. **[Frontmatter](../about/README^Frontmatter.md)**: Defines the YAML schema
   for textual notes.
2. **[Media](../about/README^Media.md)**: Extends the schema for media-specific
   content (e.g., actors, inspirations).
3. **[Components](../about/README^Components.md)**: Explains how Astro and
   React components parse and render frontmatter.
4. **[Workflow](../about/README^Workflow.md)**: Outlines best practices for
   creating, updating, and exporting notes.
5. **[Integration](../about/README^Integration.md)**: Details connections with
   tools like Obsidian, Astro, and React.
6. **[Theoretical Framework](../about/README^Theoretical_Framework.md)**:
   Explores the theories behind the system, including liminology, ANT, and
   assemblage theory.
7. **[Developer Guide](../about/README^Developer_Guide.md)**: Covers setup
   instructions, development guidelines, and contribution protocols.
8. **[User Guide](../about/README^User_Guide.md)**: Provides instructions for
   navigating and querying the digital garden, including searching and
   exporting notes.
