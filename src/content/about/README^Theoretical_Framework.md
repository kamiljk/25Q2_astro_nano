# Theoretical Framework README

## Overview

This document explains the **"why"** behind the system. It’s not just about managing notes—it’s about how knowledge evolves and connects. Concepts like **Liminology**, **Actor-Network Theory (ANT)**, and **Assemblage Theory** shape how we think about metadata and relationships between ideas.

## Core Concepts

### **Liminology**

- Knowledge isn’t static—it’s always in transition. This idea informs how we handle uncertainty and growth in notes.

### **Actor-Network Theory (ANT)**

- Everything is connected. Notes, tags, relationships—they’re all part of a larger network.

### **Assemblage Theory**

- Notes are more than the sum of their parts. Metadata, content, and relationships come together to form something bigger.

## Implications for Metadata

- **Unified Sources:** Metadata captures the web of influences behind a note. It’s not just about one source—it’s about the network.
- **Confidence Field:** This isn’t just a progress tracker—it reflects how certain or uncertain we are about an idea.
- **Portability & Flexibility:** Notes are designed to evolve. YAML frontmatter ensures they’re easy to export and adapt.

## Why This Matters

This framework isn’t just theoretical—it’s practical. It shapes how we design metadata, structure notes, and think about relationships. By understanding these concepts, you’ll see the bigger picture behind the system.
