## Definition

An **assemblage** is a *configuration of heterogeneous elements* that function together as a provisional whole while maintaining their autonomy and potential for reconfiguration. Unlike fixed structures or systems, assemblages exist in flux—constantly being made, unmade, and remade through processes of connection and disconnection.

---

## Liminal Modality

Assemblages operate precisely at **threshold zones** where:

- **Unity ↔ Multiplicity**: Functioning as wholes without losing component distinctness
- **Stability ↔ Flux**: Maintaining coherence while undergoing continuous change
- **Human ↔ Nonhuman**: Blurring boundaries between types of actors and materials
- **Material ↔ Expressive**: Integrating physical components with symbolic/semiotic elements

These boundary-crossing properties make assemblages inherently liminal entities.

## Key Attributes

### ⟐ **Relations of Exteriority**
Components maintain independence while participating in larger systems. Unlike "relations of interiority" where parts derive identity from the whole, assemblage components can detach and function in other contexts.

> *"A relation of exteriority means that the properties of component parts can never explain the relations which constitute the whole."* — DeLanda

### ⌥ **Heterogeneity**
Combines diverse elements across ontological categories:
- Material bodies
- Technologies
- Signs and symbols
- Practices and processes
- Concepts and affects

### ⊕ **Emergent Properties**
Creates capacities beyond what individual components possess alone. These emergent properties cannot be reduced to component attributes but arise from specific arrangements and interactions.

### ↻ **Processual Nature**
Assemblages are less about fixed states and more about ongoing processes:
- **Territorialization**: Processes that stabilize and define boundaries
- **Deterritorialization**: Forces that destabilize and open new possibilities
- **Reterritorialization**: Reconfiguration into new arrangements

---

## Theoretical Framework

### **Axes of Analysis**

Assemblages operate along two primary axes:

1. **Material-Expressive Axis**  
   The interplay between:
   - **Material components**: Physical bodies, technologies, resources
   - **Expressive components**: Symbols, language, affect, aesthetic qualities

2. **Territorialization-Deterritorialization Axis**  
   The tension between:
   - **Territorializing processes**: Stabilize identity, increase homogeneity
   - **Deterritorializing processes**: Destabilize identity, increase heterogeneity

### **Scales of Assemblage**

Assemblages function across multiple scales, with larger assemblages composed of smaller ones:

- **Micro-assemblages**: Bodies, devices, local interactions
- **Meso-assemblages**: Organizations, communities, ecosystems
- **Macro-assemblages**: Cities, states, global networks
- **Cosmic assemblages**: Planetary systems, interstellar phenomena

Each scale exhibits emergent properties not reducible to component assemblages.

### **Component Autonomy**

Unlike systems theory, assemblage theory emphasizes that:

- Components precede the assemblage temporally
- Components can exist outside the assemblage
- Components retain capacities independent of the assemblage
- Components can participate in multiple assemblages simultaneously

## Assemblage Dynamics

### **Formation Processes**

How assemblages come together:

1. **Catalytic Events**  
   Triggering circumstances that initiate assembly:
   - Crisis responses
   - Resource opportunities
   - Technological innovations
   - Cultural convergences

2. **Connective Logics**  
   Principles guiding what connects to what:
   - Functional compatibility
   - Symbolic resonance
   - Spatial proximity
   - Temporal synchronicity

3. **Stabilizing Mechanisms**  
   Forces that maintain assemblage coherence:
   - Material infrastructure
   - Regulatory frameworks
   - Narrative integration
   - Habitual practices

### **Transformation Pathways**

How assemblages change over time:

1. **Incremental Adaptation**  
   Gradual modifications that preserve core identity:
   - Component substitution
   - Relationship adjustments
   - Boundary maintenance
   - Scalar shifts

2. **Phase Transitions**  
   Dramatic reconfigurations that fundamentally alter assemblage identity:
   - Threshold effects
   - Cascading changes
   - Categorical shifts
   - Emergent properties

3. **Dissolution Patterns**  
   Ways assemblages come apart:
   - Component extraction
   - Relationship severing
   - Boundary collapse
   - Function cessation

## Analytical Applications

### **Social Analysis**
Examining social formations without reducing them to structures, systems, or individual actors:
- Communities as fluid arrangements rather than fixed entities
- Organizations as temporary stabilizations of diverse flows
- Social movements as emergent assemblages

### **Technological Studies**
Understanding technologies as socio-material assemblages:
- Digital platforms as assemblages of code, users, practices, and meanings
- Infrastructure as heterogeneous networks with emergent properties
- Human-machine interactions as co-constitutive assemblages

### **Environmental Thinking**
Reconceptualizing ecological relationships:
- Ecosystems as open assemblages rather than closed systems
- Environmental issues as emerging from complex assemblage interactions
- Climate as a planetary assemblage with multiple component scales

### **Cultural Analysis**
Approaching cultural phenomena as assemblages:
- Artistic works as material-expressive assemblages
- Cultural identities as provisional, heterogeneous arrangements
- Media ecologies as interconnected, evolving assemblages

## Assemblages and Power

Assemblages reshape how we understand power relations:

### **Distributed Agency**
Power emerges from arrangements rather than residing in individual actors:
- No single component controls the assemblage
- Agency distributes across human and non-human elements
- Influence operates through connection rather than domination

### **Assemblage Capacities**
Arrangements enable or constrain different types of action:
- Territorialization processes may limit possible configurations
- Material components create affordances and resistances
- Expressive elements shape what is thinkable or desirable

### **Power Geometries**
Uneven distributions within and between assemblages:
- Some components are more pivotal than others
- Certain positions enable greater connectivity
- Assemblage boundaries may include or exclude

## Assemblage Ethics

Ethical implications of assemblage thinking:

### **Responsibility in Complexity**
Navigating ethical issues when agency is distributed:
- Moving beyond individual blame/credit models
- Recognizing emergent harms and benefits
- Developing ethical frameworks for complex causality

### **Care for Assemblages**
Ethical orientations toward provisional wholes:
- Maintaining beneficial assemblages
- Supporting healthy transformation
- Facilitating constructive deterritorialization

### **Justice Across Components**
Considering fairness in heterogeneous arrangements:
- Human and non-human stakeholders
- Material and expressive dimensions
- Different temporal and spatial scales
