**Definition:**  
Truth is not an objective, fixed entity but constructed, contested, and negotiated within systems of power, discourse, and perception, existing between what is known and unknown, accepted and denied.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Regimes of Truth:** Each society has its "general politics" of truthâ€”the types of discourse it accepts and makes function as true.  
- **Power Relations:** What counts as truth is determined by who controls discourse, institutions, and knowledge production systems.  
- **Historicity:** Truth is not transcendental but historically contingent, shifting as social, political, and epistemic conditions evolve.
