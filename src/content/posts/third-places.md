**Definition:**  
Third places are social environments separate from the two usual social environments of home ("first place") and workplace ("second place"), serving as neutral grounds for informal social interaction.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Social Commons:** Functions as a flexible, informal gathering space that fosters spontaneous conversation, community bonds, and cultural exchange.  
- **Democratic Necessity:** Vital for civic engagement and social cohesion, creating neutral ground where people across backgrounds can interact freely.  
- **Liminality:** Exists between private and public, structured and unstructured, creating a transitional zone where social norms are more fluid.
