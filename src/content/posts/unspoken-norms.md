**Definition:**  
Implicit, often unconscious rules and expectations that govern behavior within social systems without being formally articulated, functioning in the liminal space between conscious regulation and emergent order.

**Key Attributes:**  
- **Tacit Enforcement:** Maintained through subtle social signals like approval, discomfort, ostracism, or confusion rather than explicit sanctions  
- **Differential Visibility:** More apparent to those who violate them than those who comply, creating asymmetric awareness between insiders and outsiders  
- **Power Embedding:** Reflect and reproduce existing power dynamics by naturalizing behaviors that advantage dominant groups while pathologizing alternatives
